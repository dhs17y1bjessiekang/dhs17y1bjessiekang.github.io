  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hi! I am Jessie Kang, a 13 year old student from <a href="http://www.dunmanhigh.moe.edu.sg">Dunman High School</a>, Singapore.</p>
  <h2>Interests</h2>
  <p>My hobbies are playing violin because I can play my favorite songs on the violin and I can convey feelings through my music. My favorite violinist is Lindsey Stirling. <a href="https://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=3&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwjDzJbjusPTAhXBtI8KHRBlA5cQFgg3MAI&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FLindsey_Stirling&usg=AFQjCNH7Woivy5XaW2ZDi0GGVaLE3kchFA&sig2=-cVZXU3UQbQiCw48VTHHtw">

  <h1> Learning Journey  </h1>
  <p> My class went to two places. One was <a href="page1.html"> MacRitchie Reservoir</a> and the other was Geylang river.</p>
  <a href="http://www.littledayout.com/wp-content/uploads/articles/2015/04-April/20150427-MacRitchieReservoir/15-bandstand-and-zig-zag-bridge.png">
    <a href= "http://www.geylangproperty.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Geylang-River-Makeover-4.jpg>
              
 <p> We tested the water quality of the water from these two places. It was a rather eye opning experience for me.</p>
              <h1> What  you can do there </h1> 
              <p> People can do water sports in MacRitchie reservoir. Or people can jog around the reservoir. At Geylang River,people can fish at certain
              parts of the river </p>
              <p> We must learn to treasure our water and all do our part to maintain the cleanliness nof our water </p>
