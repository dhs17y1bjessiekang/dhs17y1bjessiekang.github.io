 <p> We tested the water quality of the water from these two places. It was a rather eye opning experience for me.</p>
              <h1> What  you can do there </h1> 
              <p> People can do water sports in MacRitchie reservoir. Or people can jog around the reservoir. At Geylang River,people can fish at certain
              parts of the river </p>
              <p> We must learn to treasure our water and all do our part to maintain the cleanliness nof our water </p>
